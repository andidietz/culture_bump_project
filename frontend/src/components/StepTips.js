      <h4>Finding a culture bump</h4>
        <p>
          Recall a time when something caught your attention, 
          when you noticed something different or when someone 
          did something you wouldn't have done.
        </p>
        <p>Then tell what your perception was—in other words, what you thought about it.</p>
      <h4>What if the bump/situation has happened multiple times?</h4>
        <p>
          Focus on one particular time, perhaps the first time you 
          encountered the bump or the last time.
        </p>
      <h4>Don't tell the story about the incident </h4>
        <p>
          Instead of telling the story of what happened, you are looking only 
          for certain details (the person or thing you bumped with and your 
          intial thought about the incident) that will be the starting place 
          of your 8 Steps. 
        </p>
        <p>So don't talk about motivations or feelings in this step.</p>

      <h4>Keep it simple</h4>
        <p>
          Don’t tell the story. Just focus on the actions and words you 
          can see or hear. (Or, taste or touch if in the case of an 
          object).
        </p>
      <h4>What if the bump/situation has happened multiple times?</h4>
        <p>Describe exactly what you saw, heard, touched, or smelled. 
          Even though it is somewhat artificial, report exactly what 
          happened with no interpretation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Descriptive Observations: crying, hands out in front of him, 
            said “That’s cool.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-descriptive Observations: sad, nervous, rude, in an angry tone.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Don’t add how you felt or your thoughts about the incident.</h4>
        <p>
          Don’t tell the story. Just focus on the actions and words saw, 
          heard, touched, or smelled.
        </p>

      <h4>Use descriptive language only</h4>
        <p>
          Describe exactly what you  did—using only precise and literal 
          descriptive language. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Correct: I stepped backward and said, “No, thank you.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorrect: I stepped backward in fear and said nervously, 
            “No, thank you.”
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Focus on yourself</h4>
        <p>
          Don’t tell the story or add how you felt or your thoughts about 
          the other person or yourself. Just focus on your actions and words.

      <h4>Try to identify as many emotions as possible.</h4>
        <p>
          Many times we are aware of being mad or angry but underneath we 
          may feel a more "tender" or impactful emotion such as "fear" or "sad." 
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for the most “tender” or impactful emotion. It typically is 
          the last emotion you identify. (People often think, “wow, I didn’t 
          know I felt that.” when they name it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You will actually feel a “release” from the bump when you identify 
          all of your emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Some emotions may contradict one another.
        </p>
        <h4>Focus on yourself</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Correct: sad, honored, weary
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorrect: he made me..., I thought they were..., he was scared, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Do not describe why you felt an emotion or use words like: felt like, 
        felt that, or felt about. 
      </h4>
        <p>
          Don’t tell the story or add how you felt or your thoughts about 
          the other person or yourself. Just focus on your actions and words.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Correct: sad, honored, weary
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorrect: normal, upset, tired, hungry, 
          </li>

          Example List of Emotions:
        </p>

          <li>
            Surprise: Shock, astonishment, amazement, wonder

      <h4>Why do you think they did what they did?</h4>
        <p>
          When asking yourself "why" the other person did what they did, you 
          are trying to identify the situation to which they were responding—not 
          to “understand” the other person(s)’ motive. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Their action was in response to a particular situation. If you 
          were in the same situation, you would most likely have responded 
          differently. Here you are looking to pin point what that situation 
          might have been.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry about trying to pick the exact "correct" situation. Just 
          try to find a universal situation that could have led to their response 
          and your culture bump.
        </p>
        <p>
          The situation usually begins with a verb such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wanting to...
          </li>
          <li>
            Needing to...
          </li>
          <li>
            Explaining...
          </li>
          <li>
            Being...
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Is it a Universal?</h4>
        <p>
          Universal Situations are something anyone from any culture could find 
          themselves in. Here are some helpful tips:
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of specific people's names, change it to their role in the 
          situation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Explaining...
          </li>
          <li>
            Being...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can add more details to make it specific such as: 
          Roles of the individuals involved, the ages, pertinent relationships, 
          gender, or whether the situation occurred in public or in private.
        </p>
    </div>
  )
}

const step6Tips = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Use descriptive language</h4>
        <p>
        Try to make the behavior as precise and vivid as possible—Add as 
        many details as you can recall. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Don’t focus on why you did anything in this step.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Correct: I stepped backward and said, “No, thank you.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorrect: I stepped backward in fear and said nervously, 
            “No, thank you.”
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>There may be more than one pattern of behavior on yourself</h4>
        <p>
          Often we learn behaviors from family, teachers, personal 
          experiences, or our own personalities which may mean that what 
          you would do might be different from your community at large, or 
          that there are several possible responses to this same situation.
        </p>
        <h4>Image yourself in that exact situation</h4>
        <p>
          If you cannot remember being in the exact situation, imagine 
          what you would do if you ever found yourself in a similar 
          position. Or you might think of what someone from your "group" 
          would do in that situation.

      <h4>Finding Qualities</h4>
        <p>
          Remember in Step 1, when you said "I thought that was...(rude, silly, nice, etc)." You were associating an action someone did with a quality. This is similar. You associate the actions above in step six with certain qualities. When your brain see someone doing those actions, it thinks (often subconsciously) "Oh they are being...(considerate, wise, etc)."
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine yourself in that situation or that you are watching someone doing the actions you listed in Step 6, and then ask yourself, "What kind of person acts or speaks that way?"
        </p>
        <h4>Avoid using normal or “not</h4>
        <p>
          Do not use the word Normal. ("They're being normal.") Look deeper to find the specific qualities that make the action "feel" than normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to pick the exact quality instead of merely stating “NOT....”
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a list of a few of the millions of human qualities. Notice that qualities can be positive or negative.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Selfless
            Thoughtful
